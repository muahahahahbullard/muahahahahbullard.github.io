        <h1>The Cabin.</h1>
        <h3> You're on a path in the woods. And at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a princess. You're here to slay her. If you don't, it will be the end of the world.
            <br>
            You step inside the cabin. A pristine blade lies on a table to your left. Short, Triangular, Reliable. On the right, there is a mirror, coated in a thin film of dust, yet the glimmer of the starlit night reflects through the smooth glass.
            <br>
            And right in front of you, is a basement. it has a long, winding hallway down, unfinished, like a mineshaft, and smelling of earth and old, dryrotted wood.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>You have been left with 3 choices, prior to you meeting the princess
                <ul>
                   <li> <a href="./DecentWithWeapon.html"> You can grab the blade, then make your decent</a></li>
                    
                   <li> <a href="./UnarmedDecent.html">You can make your decent unarmed</a></li>
                
                   <li> <a href="./Cowardlyretreat.html">You can turn around, and hope the burden of taking a life is laid on another's hand</a></li>

        <h1>Rest easy. We'll be here when you come back.</h1>
        <p>It is no secret that our sun is getting older. It 
        happens to everyone, and celestial bodies are no exception.
        We at Jet3 like to assure everyone who stays with us that 
        our sun's looming expansion serves us no worry. Our wonderful 
        Europa will pick up a tropical tone, with beautiful red skies, 
        85 hours a day. Our facilities are built to withstand a shift 
        in temperature, and with a boat in every hallway, you can rest 
        assured knowing that we'll continue to float your boat long after
        our ice melts away.</p><br>
        <p>Jet3 would like to remind its valued guests that once the planet is 
        dry, all travel packages will be voided and the planet must be 
        vacated. Those working on-world will be permitted to stay under the 
        stipulation that they are outfitted and ready by the time the work horn
        blasts.</p>

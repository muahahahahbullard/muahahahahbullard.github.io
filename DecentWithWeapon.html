        <h1> You took the blade...</h1>
        <h3>and began your journey down the basement steps, each step mushing into the soil floor. every stride tightening your grip on the blade as the tension eats at you.
            <br>
            After what felt like forever. you see.. the princess. she takes a sharp glance at your blade and takes up a petulant tone, "Here to slay me, are we?"
            <br>
            But you have no response, youre only here to slay her.. or are you?

        <h3> and the princess flinches back, however, every thrown fist connects with her flash. bruising. heavy. and bloody. she slumps to the floor under the thumps of your heavy hands <br>
        Bones crack with every blow. Crush. snap. crack. shatter. you dont stop until theres a puddle at your heat and mangled flash at your hands.
    <br>
This however, did it. you saved the world. you slain the princess. you can leave now, especcially now that your hateful hands are done with their work
<br> 
you walk towards the basement, and up the stairs, and when you open the door and leave. youre met with
<h1>Darkness.</h1></h3>

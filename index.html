        <h1>Chapter.. ONE, Sammy the ogre stopper.</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a kind, yet grumpy, old man named sammy. He had a gruff goatee, and a stature of a skeleton, yet he had the strength of 100 oxen.
            <br>
            And there was an Ogre, Tyre, who kept destroying his garden, until one fatefull day...
            <br>
            <h2> DONK </h2>
            The ogre was felled.
        </p>
        <h1> Chapter 2... the call for riches</h1>
        <p> Once the ogre had fallen, our hero, sammy, was bestowed upon by the village's mayor many riches as thanks.
            <br>
            However, with these riches, Sammy had nothing left to work for, his farm didnt generate money that he usually needed, his hobbies didnt cost him a noticeable penny
            <br>
            He had no passion left for what he loved to do, since his riches tainted the joy in the world, feeling that everything tasted better when there was less cheese to spread on the cracker.
